## Interface Overview

1. **Wallet**: This section of the interface is used to manage wallets. You can create a wallet using Aptosâ€™s `keyless account`. After selecting a network, click the `Google Login` button to create a wallet. Please note that wallets created using keyless account will require re-authentication after a specific period. The currently supported networks are `Devnet` and `Testnet`.
1. **Workspace**: This section of the interface allows you to compile or deploy Smart Contracts. If you have multiple smart contracts in your repository, you can select the specific smart contract (`Move.toml`) and proceed with compilation or deployment.

## Requirements

- **Aptos CLI**: Install the Aptos command-line interface to interact with the Aptos blockchain.
